# Blind / Low Vision Navigational Aid

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a system for blind and low vision sailors, in partnership with [sailability NSW](https://sailabilitynsw.com.au/). The system integrates GPS, LoRa and ESP32 hardware to enable real-time feedback and collision avoidance with other boats. Spoken readings are generated through text-to-speech alerts, providing distance and bearing with clock-position announcements.
